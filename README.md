One popular architecture used to solve this problem is the VGG16 model, which is a deep convolutional neural network with 16 layers. The model was pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset and fine-tuned on the Intel image classification dataset. The model achieved an accuracy of 92.2% on the test set, which is higher than the required accuracy of 88-90%.

Another architecture used to solve this problem is the ResNet50 model, which is another deep convolutional neural network with 50 layers. The model was also pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset and fine-tuned on the Intel image classification dataset. The model achieved an accuracy of 93.8% on the test set, which is higher than the required accuracy of 88-90%.
